# A Movies App with React JS

I just began my React JS journey and this is my first app.
I must say that some of the concepts are still not very clear to me but as an enthusiastic learner, I know I will grasp them in the not distant future with discipline and practice.

This project was created with tutorial and free resources from Adrian Hajdin, you can check his YouTube channel for amazing JavaScript content - [JavaScript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/c/JavaScriptMastery).
